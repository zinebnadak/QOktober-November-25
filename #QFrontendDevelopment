#Remember how to open and test your .html file (that you’ve written in PyCharm) this will be your routine:

--- 03 HTML ---
# These two methods Or just copy the path by clicking on "project" on the left handside and then paste in web browser

#Method 1
Using PyCharm to Open the HTML File
If you’re using PyCharm and have an HTML file ready, here’s how to open it directly from the IDE:
1. Locate the file in PyCharm:
    * In PyCharm, open the project where you’ve written your .html file.
    * In the "Project" pane on the left, navigate to the folder that contains your HTML file.
2. Open the HTML file:
    * Double-click on the .html file to open it in the editor.
3. Preview the HTML file:
    * If you have the "Web Browser" tool enabled (usually in the lower-right corner or toolbar):
        * You might see a little icon (like a browser) to the right of the editor. Clicking that should open your HTML file in the default web browser directly.
        * This works for testing basic static files like HTML, CSS, and images.


#Method 2
Opening HTML Locally on Your Computer with Python's Built-In Web Server
This method involves creating a folder to store your HTML and any other assets (like images or gifs), then testing it locally via a Python web server. Here’s a detailed guide:

Step 1: Create a Folder Locally
1. Open Finder on your Mac.
2. Navigate to your Home folder (or any folder where you want to store your project).
3. Create a New Folder:
    * Right-click or use the "New Folder" option, and name it something relevant like html_test_project.

Step 2: Add HTML File and Other Assets
1. Place your .html file inside this newly created folder.
2. If you have any images (like gifs or pictures), make sure you place them in the same folder as your .html file.
    * For example, if you have an image called myimage.gif, make sure it’s in the same folder as your index.html.
3. Update the HTML to reference the image correctly:
    * In your HTML file, make sure the image or gif is referenced correctly, like this:
img src="myimage.gif" alt="Description of the image"  

Step 3: Open the Terminal and Navigate to Your Folder
1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Navigate to your folder by using the cd command:
cd /path/to/html_test_project  - Replace /path/to/html_test_project with the actual path to your folder. For example, if you put it in your home folder, it might look like:  cd ~/html_test_project  

Step 4: Start a Local Web Server Using Python
1. Run the Python web server:
    * Once inside the folder with your HTML and image files, run the following command:

python3 -m http.server  
    * This starts a simple HTTP server on your computer. By default, it listens on port 8000.
1. Server will start and should show output similar to this:  Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000) ...  

Step 5: Open the HTML File in a Browser
1. Open your web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Safari, etc.).
2. Go to the URL:
    * Type the following in the address bar:  http://localhost:8000/index.html 
        * Make sure you use the correct file name if your file is named differently (like home.html or my_page.html).
    * You should now be able to see your HTML file rendered in the browser!

Troubleshooting Tips
* Images Not Showing: If your images or gifs are not displaying, make sure the paths are correct in your HTML file (i.e., they should be relative paths like src="myimage.gif" if both files are in the same folder).
* Port Conflict: If port 8000 is already in use, you can specify a different port by running:  python3 -m http.server 8080  Then visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.




# Introduction to HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for a deeper dive into UI
# use sublime for mac as editor (for windows use notepad as editor)
# It’s not a programming language — it’s a markup language, which means it’s used to structure content.
# Think of HTML as “telling the browser what kind of content something is.”

--- 03 HTML 1 ---

#1 Briefly explain HTML 4, HTML 5 and XHTML!
#
# HTML 4.01 (released in 1999) was essentially a minor revision of HTML 4,and aimed to separate content from presentation, encouraging the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling instead of inline attributes. It introduced a more structured and semantic way of building web pages.
# HTML5 introduced many new elements and features to support modern web applications, multimedia, and better performance on mobile devices. It also made the syntax cleaner and more flexible. HTML5 includes new semantic elements and better support for APIs, like audio, video, and geolocation.
# XHTML was developed to combine HTML's ease of use with XML's strict syntax rules. It was intended to make HTML documents more reliable and consistent by enforcing a stricter syntax. XHTML must be well-formed XML, which means:
- All tags must be closed (e.g., <br />, <img />).
- Tags must be properly nested.
- All attribute values must be quoted (e.g., src="image.jpg").
- The document must have a proper DOCTYPE and comply with XML’s case-sensitivity (all tags must be lowercase).

#2 What are elements and tags? (and attributes)
# Fundamental concepts that help define the structure and content of a web page.

# An HTML element is a complete structure used to define content on a webpage. It consists of an opening tag, content (optional), and a closing tag. The element tells the browser what kind of content it is displaying and how to structure it.
Basic Structure of an Element:
<tagname>Content goes here</tagname>

examples of different elements:
<p> is an element that defines a paragraph of text.
<h1> is an element used to define the largest heading.


# A tag is a part of an HTML element and defines the type of the element. There are two types of tags:
- Opening tag: Marks the beginning of an element. <tagname>
- Closing tag: Marks the end of an element. </tagname> (note the forward slash / before the tag name)

Attributes provide additional information about an element, such as styles, classes, or other properties. They are written inside the opening tag and are usually composed of a name and a value.
<tagname attribute="value">Content goes here</tagname>

#3 Common HTML Tags
<html>: Defines the start of an HTML document.
<head>: Contains meta-information, links to stylesheets, and other resources.
<body>: Contains the content of the webpage that the user will see.
<h1> to <h6>: Heading tags. <h1> is the most important and largest, <h6> is the smallest.
<p>: Represents a paragraph.
<a>: Anchor tag, used to create hyperlinks.
<img>: Displays an image.
<ul>: Unordered list.
<ol>: Ordered list (with numbered items).
<table>: Creates a table.
<div>: A generic container used for grouping content (used with CSS for layout)
<span>: A generic inline container used to style part of a text or other content.
<img> element is used to display images on a webpage.
<br> element is used to insert a line break, which means it moves content to the next line, similar to how pressing Enter works in a text editor.

#4 explain the structure of nested elements in HTML
elements do always need to be provided in a structrue similar to "onion rings".
Nesting refers to placing one HTML element inside another. This is a fundamental concept in HTML because it allows you to create complex structures and organize content in a logical, hierarchical way.
When elements are nested, they form a parent-child relationship, where:
- The parent element is the element that contains other elements (its children).
- The child element is the element that is nested inside the parent.

<parent-element>
    <child-element>
        <nested-child-element>Content here</nested-child-element>
    </child-element>
</parent-element>


#5 Explain how Nesting Works with Tags, and its core structure
In HTML, block-level elements (like <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, etc.) can contain inline elements (like <span>, <a>, <strong>, etc.).
<p>This is a <strong>bold</strong> text.</p>
<p> is a block element containing an inline element <strong>.
<strong> makes the text inside it bold.


#6 What is meta data?
Metadata refers to data about data.
In the context of web development, meta tags in HTML are used to provide information about a webpage to browsers, search engines, and other external systems.

#7 What does "gif" stand for?
GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. It is a bitmap image format that supports both static and animated images


--- 04 HTML 1 ---
#8 10 most common tags

<h1> or <h6>
#Headings where h1 is the largest and h6 is the smallest

<p>
#used for blocks of text. Browsers add space before and after paragraphs automatically

<a>
# Anchor (link) — used to link to another webpage or a part of the same page. The href attribute defines the link’s destination.
# <a href="https://google.com"> Visit Google</a>

<img>
# Image — displays an image on the page. The src attribute specifies the image file, and alt describes it (for accessibility and in case the image can’t load).
# <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cute cat"

<ul>
# Unordered list — creates a list with bullet points. Each item inside must use <li>.
# <ul><li>Item</li></ul> → Displays a bulleted list with one item.

<ol>
# Ordered list — creates a numbered list. Each item inside must use <li>
# <ol><li>First</li></ol> --> Displays a numbered list starting with “1.”

<li>
# List item — defines an item in either an ordered (<ol>) or unordered (<ul>) list.
# <li>Item</li> → A single list entry.

<div>
# Block-level container — used to group larger sections of content (like paragraphs, headings, or images). Often styled with CSS.
# <div>This is a block.</div> → A block section that starts on a new line.

<span>
# Inline container — used to group small pieces of text or elements within a line (e.g., to style or highlight them).
# <span>Highlight this</span> → A short inline element you can style separately.

<br>
#Line break — forces text to move to a new line. It’s an empty tag (no closing tag)
