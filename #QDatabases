DATABASES

Without databases, none of the IT systems we rely on could function reliably and efficiently.
In this course, we cover the fundamental principles of databases in both theory and practice.
We focus primarily on relational databases and the SQL query language, but we also get acquainted with document databases.

1. Database
Question: What is a database and why is it important in managing data? Answer: A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and managed to allow for easy retrieval, modification, and organization. It is important because it helps store large amounts of data efficiently, maintain data integrity, and provide a method for querying and analyzing the data.

2. Table (Relation)
Question: What is a table in a relational database, and how does it organize data? Answer: A table in a relational database is a collection of data organized into rows (records) and columns (attributes). Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute of that record. Tables allow you to structure and store data logically.

3. Row (Tuple)
Question: What is a row (or tuple) in a relational database, and what kind of information does it represent? Answer: A row (or tuple) is a single, complete record in a table, representing a unique entity or instance. For example, in a "Customers" table, each row might represent a single customer with attributes like CustomerID, Name, and Email.

4. Column (Attribute)
Question: What is the role of a column (attribute) in a relational database table, and how is it defined? Answer: A column (attribute) in a table defines a specific type of data stored for each record. For instance, in a "Users" table, columns might include Username, Email, and DateOfBirth. Each column has a defined data type (e.g., VARCHAR, INT, DATE).

5. Primary Key (PK)
Question: What is a primary key, and why must it be unique in every row of a table? Answer: A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must be unique and cannot contain NULL values to ensure that every record is distinct and can be efficiently accessed or referenced.

6. Foreign Key (FK)
Question: How does a foreign key create a relationship between two tables in a relational database? Answer: A foreign key is a column in one table that references the primary key of another table. This relationship links data between the two tables, ensuring referential integrity by making sure the data in the foreign key column corresponds to an existing value in the referenced table.

7. Domain
Question: What is a domain in the context of a relational database, and how does it affect the values a column can hold? Answer: A domain is the set of allowable values for a given column. It defines the valid range of values that can be stored in that column, such as specifying that a Age column can only hold integer values between 0 and 150 or that an Email column should follow a specific pattern.

8. Cardinality
Question: What are the three types of cardinality in database relationships, and how do they impact how tables are related? Answer:
* One-to-One (1:1): Each record in one table is related to exactly one record in another table.
* One-to-Many (1:M): One record in a table can be related to many records in another table.
* Many-to-Many (M:N): Multiple records in one table can be related to multiple records in another table (often managed by a junction table). Cardinality defines how tables are linked and the type of relationship they share.

9. Normalization
Question: What is the purpose of database normalization, and how does it improve the structure of the data? Answer: Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. By dividing large tables into smaller ones and establishing relationships between them, normalization minimizes duplication, ensures consistency, and makes the database easier to maintain.

10. SQL (Structured Query Language)
Question: What is SQL, and what role does it play in interacting with relational databases? Answer: SQL is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete data (CRUD operations), as well as define the structure of the database (e.g., CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE), and query data (e.g., SELECT).

11. Unique Key
Question: How does a unique key differ from a primary key, and when might it be used? Answer: A unique key ensures that all values in a column are distinct, similar to a primary key. However, unlike a primary key, a unique key can allow NULL values (unless otherwise restricted). It's useful when you need to enforce uniqueness for a column but don't want it to be the primary identifier for records.

12. Index
Question: What is an index in a database, and how does it improve data retrieval performance? Answer: An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations by creating a data structure (often a tree or hash) to quickly locate records. It's like an index in a book, making searches faster but slightly slower when inserting or updating data.

13. NULL
Question: What does a NULL value represent in a relational database, and how does it differ from an empty string or zero? Answer: A NULL value represents the absence of a value or unknown data. It is different from an empty string ("") or zero (0), which are valid data entries. NULL is used to indicate missing or undefined data.

14. Relationship Between Tables
Question: How do relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) help organize data in a relational database? Answer: Relationships define how data in one table is related to data in another. They help avoid redundancy, enforce integrity, and make it possible to query data across multiple tables. For example, a one-to-many relationship links a customer to multiple orders, while a many-to-many relationship links students to multiple courses through a junction table.

15. Schema
Question: What is a database schema, and what does it define in terms of table structure and relationships? Answer: A schema is the logical design or blueprint of a database, including the tables, columns, relationships, and constraints. It defines the structure and organization of the data, ensuring that all data is stored consistently and efficiently.

16. Transactions
Question: What is a transaction in a database, and what are the key properties that ensure its reliability (ACID)? Answer: A transaction is a sequence of database operations that are executed as a single unit. The ACID properties ensure reliability:
* Atomicity: All operations in a transaction must succeed or fail together.
* Consistency: The database moves from one valid state to another.
* Isolation: Transactions are isolated from one another.
* Durability: Once committed, changes are permanent.

17. SQL Joins
Question: What is the difference between an INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN in SQL, and how are they used to retrieve data from multiple tables? Answer:
* INNER JOIN: Returns only rows with matching values in both tables.
* LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table (if no match, NULL is returned for the right).
* RIGHT JOIN: Similar to LEFT JOIN, but returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left. These joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.


KEYS 


^18. Primary Key (PK)
Question: What is the purpose of a primary key in a relational database, and what are its key properties? Answer: The primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table. Its key properties are:
* Uniqueness: The primary key column must contain unique values for every row.
* Non-NULL: A primary key cannot contain NULL values, ensuring that every row has a unique identifier.
* One per table: A table can only have one primary key, but this can consist of one or more columns (composite key).

^19. Foreign Key (FK)
Question: How does a foreign key work in a relational database, and what does it enforce? Answer: A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in one table that links to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables, such as one-to-many or many-to-many. The foreign key enforces referential integrity, meaning the value in the foreign key column must exist in the referenced table. It can allow NULL values, indicating an optional relationship.

20. Unique Key
Question: What is a unique key, and how does it differ from a primary key? Answer: A unique key ensures that all values in a column are unique, similar to a primary key. However, it differs in that:
* A unique key can allow NULL values (unless explicitly restricted).
* A table can have multiple unique keys, but only one primary key. Unique keys are often used to enforce uniqueness on attributes like emails, usernames, or product codes.

21. Composite Key
Question: What is a composite key, and when is it necessary to use one? Answer: A composite key is a primary key that consists of two or more columns. It is used when a single column cannot uniquely identify a record, such as in many-to-many relationships. For example, in a "CourseEnrollments" table, the combination of StudentID and CourseID may serve as a composite key.

^22. Candidate Key
Question: What is a candidate key, and how does it relate to the primary key? Answer: A candidate key is any column or set of columns that can uniquely identify a row in a table. A table can have multiple candidate keys, but only one is selected to be the primary key. All candidate keys must have unique values and cannot be NULL, but only one is chosen to represent the record uniquely.

23. Alternate Key
Question: What is an alternate key, and how is it different from a primary key? Answer: An alternate key is a candidate key that was not chosen as the primary key. While a table can have multiple candidate keys, only one is selected as the primary key, and the others become alternate keys. Alternate keys help ensure data integrity and can still serve as unique identifiers for records.

24. Superkey
Question: What is a superkey, and how does it differ from a primary key? Answer: A superkey is a set of columns that can uniquely identify a row in a table. It can include the primary key and any additional columns that aren’t necessary for uniqueness. Every primary key is a superkey, but not every superkey is a primary key, as superkeys may contain extra, redundant columns.

25. Natural Key
Question: What is a natural key, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of using one? Answer: A natural key is a key that is derived from real-world data, such as a Social Security Number or ISBN. The advantage is that it is meaningful and easy to understand. However, natural keys can be problematic because they may change over time (e.g., a person's address or email), making them less stable and reliable than surrogate keys.

26. Surrogate Key
Question: What is a surrogate key, and why would you choose to use one instead of a natural key or composite key? Answer: A surrogate key is a system-generated key (often an auto-incremented number or GUID) used to uniquely identify a record. It has no business meaning and is typically used when natural keys are cumbersome, unreliable, or subject to change. Surrogate keys provide a stable and efficient means of uniquely identifying records.

27. Primary Key vs Foreign Key
Question: What is the difference between a primary key and a foreign key in relational databases? Answer: A primary key uniquely identifies a record within its own table, while a foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in one table that points to the primary key in another table. The primary key ensures that each record in its table is unique, while the foreign key establishes a relationship between tables.

28. Composite Key vs Primary Key
Question: When would you use a composite key rather than a primary key in a table? Answer: A composite key is used when no single column can uniquely identify a record. It’s necessary in cases where two or more columns together provide uniqueness. This typically happens in junction tables (many-to-many relationships), where a combination of attributes (like StudentID and CourseID) uniquely identifies records.

29. Surrogate Key vs Natural Key
Question: Why would you choose a surrogate key over a natural key? Answer: A surrogate key is chosen over a natural key when the natural key is either:
* Too cumbersome or complex (e.g., a combination of multiple columns),
* Prone to change (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers), or
* Not optimal for database efficiency. A surrogate key is stable, easy to generate, and simplifies database design, as it does not rely on real-world attributes.

30. Unique Key vs Primary Key
Question: How is a unique key different from a primary key, and in what situations would you use each? Answer: Both unique keys and primary keys ensure that column values are unique. However:
* A primary key is the main identifier for records and cannot contain NULL values.
* A unique key also enforces uniqueness but can allow NULL values (unless restricted). You would use a primary key for the column that uniquely identifies records, and a unique key to enforce uniqueness on other important attributes (like an email address or username).

31. What are the three levels of the database architecture, and what does each level represent?
Answer: The three-level database architecture consists of the following levels:
External Level: This represents the user's view of the database. It describes the part of the database that is relevant to a specific user or group of users, focusing on how the data appears to them. Different users may have different views of the same data depending on their needs.
Conceptual Level: This is the community view of the database, representing the entire database's structure as seen by all users. It describes what data is stored in the database, the relationships among the data, and the constraints on that data, without focusing on how the data is physically stored.
Internal Level: This level deals with the physical representation of the database on the computer. It describes how the data is actually stored, organized, and managed on storage devices, including the structure of files, indexing, and access paths.

32. What is DDL?
Answer: Data Definition Language

33. What is DML?
Answer: Data Manipulation Language - General enquiry facility (query language) of the data

34. What is ER?
Answer: Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams and data dictionaries which together make up a conceptual design of the database

35. What is a tuple, degree and cardinality?
Answer: Tuple a row of a relation, Degree is the number of attributes in a relation and Cardinality is the number of tuples in a relation.

36. What is a tuple in a relational database, and what does it represent?
Answer: A tuple is a row in a relation (table) that contains a set of values for each attribute (column). Each tuple represents a unique instance or record in the database. For example, in a "Customers" table, a tuple might represent a single customer, with values for attributes like CustomerID, Name, and Email.

37. What does the degree of a relation represent in a relational database?
Answer: The degree of a relation refers to the number of attributes (columns) in a table. It tells you how many fields are included in each tuple (row). For example, a "Products" table with columns for ProductID, ProductName, Price, and Stock has a degree of 4.

38. What is the cardinality of a relation, and what does it measure?
Answer: The cardinality of a relation refers to the number of tuples (rows) in a table. It measures how many records are stored in that relation. For instance, if the "Employees" table has 200 rows, the cardinality of that relation is 200.

39. How are the terms tuple, degree, and cardinality related in the context of a relational database?
Answer: In a relational database, a tuple is a single record (row) in a table. The degree of a table is the number of attributes (columns) it has, and the cardinality refers to the number of tuples (rows) in that table. Together, these concepts describe the structure and size of a table:

A table has multiple tuples (rows),
Each tuple contains values for a certain number of attributes (columns),
The cardinality is the total number of rows in the table.

40. How would you calculate the cardinality and degree of a table like this one:

EmployeeID	Name	Position	Salary
1	Alice	Manager	80000
2	Bob	Developer	60000
3	Charlie	Developer	62000

Answer:Degree: This table has 4 columns: EmployeeID, Name, Position, and Salary. So, the degree is 4.
Cardinality: The table has 3 rows (one for each employee), so the cardinality is 3.

41. Is there a difference between a tuple and a row in a relational database?
Answer: No, in the context of relational databases, the terms tuple and row are used interchangeably. Both refer to a single, complete record in a table, which contains values for each attribute defined by the table's columns.

42. What is database integrity, and why is it important?
Answer: Database integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the data stored in a database. It is maintained through constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique keys, as well as through normalization. Database integrity ensures that the data is accurate and consistent over its lifecycle, preventing errors and inconsistencies that could arise from improper data manipulation.

43. What are the ACID properties of a database transaction, and why are they crucial?
Answer: The ACID properties ensure the reliability of database transactions:
These properties ensure that the database remains accurate, reliable, and free of inconsistencies during concurrent operations.

Atomicity: A transaction is an all-or-nothing operation; it must complete fully or not at all.

Consistency: A transaction moves the database from one valid state to another.

Isolation: Transactions are isolated from each other, so their intermediate states are not visible to other transactions.

Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it is permanent and will survive system failures.

44. What is referential integrity, and how does it affect relationships between tables?
Answer: Referential integrity ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent. It enforces rules so that a foreign key value in one table must either be null or match a primary key value in another table. This helps prevent orphaned records and ensures that the database structure is maintained correctly.

45. What is a stored procedure, and how is it used in a relational database?
A stored procedure is a precompiled set of SQL statements stored in the database that can be executed by calling the procedure name. It allows for complex operations to be encapsulated and reused. Stored procedures improve performance and security by allowing for code reuse and minimizing the need for repetitive SQL queries.

46. What is a database trigger, and how does it work?
A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that is automatically executed in response to certain events on a particular table or view, such as insertions, updates, or deletions. Triggers can be used to enforce business rules, validate data, or audit database changes.

47. What is the difference between normalization and denormalization, and when is each approach used?
Answer:
Normalization is the process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by dividing large tables into smaller, related tables. It is useful for maintaining consistency and reducing the risk of anomalies.
Denormalization is the process of merging tables to improve query performance at the cost of introducing some redundancy. Denormalization might be used when performance is a higher priority than strict data integrity, such as in data warehousing or read-heavy applications.

48. What is a view in SQL, and what purpose does it serve?
Answer: A view is a virtual table that is created by querying one or more underlying tables. It allows users to access and manipulate data as though it were a single table, even if the data is spread across multiple tables. Views can simplify complex queries and provide a layer of security by restricting access to specific columns or rows.

49. What is data redundancy, and why should it be avoided in a relational database?
Data redundancy refers to the unnecessary duplication of data across a database. It should be avoided because it can lead to inconsistencies, increased storage requirements, and maintenance challenges. Normalization helps minimize redundancy by ensuring that each piece of data is stored only once in the database.

50. What are some common database security practices, and why are they important?
Answer: Common database security practices include:
Authentication and Authorization: Ensuring that users are who they say they are (authentication) and limiting access to data based on user roles (authorization).
Encryption: Protecting sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
Backups: Regularly backing up data to prevent loss in case of failure.
Auditing: Monitoring and logging database activity to detect unauthorized access or changes.
These practices are essential for protecting sensitive information, maintaining privacy, and ensuring the integrity and availability of the database.

51. What is the difference between a data warehouse and an operational database?
Answer:
Data Warehouse: A system used for reporting and data analysis, optimized for read-heavy operations. It stores historical data from multiple sources and is used for decision-making and analytics.
Operational Database: A system used for managing day-to-day operations, optimized for transaction processing. It stores current data that is frequently updated, such as customer orders or inventory information.

52. What is sharding, and how does it improve database scalability?
Answer: Sharding is a method of horizontal partitioning where data is distributed across multiple servers or nodes to improve performance and scalability.
Each shard contains a subset of the data, and queries are directed to the appropriate shard.
This allows for handling large amounts of data and high traffic loads by distributing the workload.





--- Relational algebra and calculus ---
Q1: What are relational algebra and relational calculus?
A1: They are formal languages associated with the relational model in databases.

Procedural means you specify how to do something
Non-procedural (or declarative) means you specify what you want, not how to get it.

Q2: Is relational algebra procedural or non-procedural?
A2: Relational algebra is a procedural language — it specifies how a query is carried out.

Q3: Is relational calculus procedural or non-procedural?
A3: Relational calculus is non-procedural — it specifies what data to retrieve, not how.

Q4: Are relational algebra and relational calculus equivalent?
A4: Yes, formally they are equivalent in expressive power.

Q5: What does it mean if a language is relationally complete?
A5: It means the language can produce any relation that can be derived using relational algebra or calculus.

Q6: What kind of foundation do relational algebra and calculus have?
A6: They have a rigorous mathematical foundation.

Q7: What are relational algebra and calculus used for?
A7: They are used for reasoning, query optimization, and understanding the theoretical basis of database queries.
Query optimization means finding the most efficient way to execute a database query — that is, how to get the same correct result while using the least time, memory, or other resources.

Q8: How is SQL related to relational algebra?
A8: Relational Algebra provides the theoretical foundation for how data is manipulated in relational databases.
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a practical implementation of those ideas. every SQL query can be represented as a sequence of relational algebra operations (like SELECT, PROJECT, JOIN, etc.).
But SQL is more powerful — it’s a superset of relational algebra because it also includes:
- Aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, AVG, SUM)
- Grouping and ordering
- String and date operations
- Formatting and output control

Q9: How does SQL compare to relational algebra in terms of semantics and syntax?
A9: SQL has more complicated semantics but simpler syntax, closer to natural language.
Semantics — how the language behaves or what it means
Syntax — how the language looks (the structure or form)

Q10: What does relational algebra operate on?
A10: It operates on one or more relations (tables) to define a new relation without changing the originals.

Q11: Can the output of one relational algebra operation be used as input for another?
A11: Yes — both operands and results are relations, so operations can be nested, like arithmetic expressions.

Q12: What are the five basic operations in relational algebra?
A12:
- Selection
- Projection
- Cartesian Product
- Union
- Set Difference

Q13: What additional operations can also be expressed using the five basic ones?
A13: Join, Intersection, and Division.

Q14: Which two operations are examined first in relational algebra?
A14: Selection and Projection.

Q15: What does the Selection (σ) operation do?
A15: It selects rows (tuples) from a relation that satisfy a specific condition (predicate).

Q16: What is the Greek symbol used for Selection?
A16: The lowercase sigma (σ).

Q17: What does the Projection (π) operation do?
A17: It selects specific columns (attributes) from a relation and removes duplicates.

Q18: What is the Greek symbol used for Projection?
A18: The uppercase pi (π).

Q19: Are Selection and Projection unary or binary operations?
A19: They are unary operations — they work on a single relation.

Q20: What is the difference between unary and binary operations in relational algebra?
A20: Unary operations (like Selection and Projection) work on one relation.
Binary operations work on pairs of relations (e.g., Union, Cartesian Product).

Q21: What does σ_salary > 2900(Staff) mean?
A21: It lists all staff whose salary is greater than 2900 — a Selection operation.

Q22: What does π_staffNo, fName, lName, salary(Staff) mean?
A22: It produces a list showing only those four columns for all staff — a Projection operation.

Q23: What happens when you combine Projection and Selection?
A23: You can filter rows first (Selection) and then choose specific columns (Projection).

Q24: What is the relational calculus expression corresponding to that combined query?
A24:
{ s.staffNo, s.fName, s.lName, s.salary | Staff(s) ∧ s.salary > 2400 }
This means:
“Select staff numbers, first and last names, and salary from all tuples in Staff where the salary is greater than 2400.”

--- Basic SQL --- COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG (aggerate functions)
Q1. What does an aggregate function do in SQL?
A1. It operates on a single column of a table and returns a single value that summarizes the data in that column.

Q2. How many aggregate functions are defined by the ISO SQL standard?
A2. Five.

Q3. What are the five aggregate functions defined by the ISO SQL standard?
A3.COUNT – returns the number of values in a column.
SUM – returns the sum of values in a column.
AVG – returns the average of values in a column.
MIN – returns the smallest value in a column.
MAX – returns the largest value in a column.

Q4. Which aggregate functions can be used with both numeric and non-numeric fields?
A4. COUNT, MIN, and MAX.

Q5. Which aggregate functions can only be used with numeric fields?
A5. SUM and AVG.

Q6. What does COUNT(*) do?
A6. It counts all rows in a table, including those with NULL or duplicate values.

Q7. How do other aggregate functions handle NULL values?
A7. Except for COUNT(*), all aggregate functions ignore NULL values and operate only on the remaining non-null data.

Q8. How can you eliminate duplicates before applying an aggregate function?
A8. Use the keyword DISTINCT before the column name (e.g., COUNT(DISTINCT columnName)).

Q9. In which SQL clauses can aggregate functions be used?
A9. Only in the SELECT list and the HAVING clause.

Q10. Can aggregate functions be used in the WHERE clause?
A10. No, they cannot be used in the WHERE clause.

Q11. What restriction applies when using aggregate functions in a SELECT statement without a GROUP BY clause?
A11. The SELECT list should not include any columns that are not inside an aggregate function.

Q12. Give an example of an illegal query according to the SQL standard.
A12. SELECT staffNo, fName, lName, MAX(salary) FROM Staff;

Q13. How do you count how many properties cost less than 800 per month to rent?

Q18. What does each aggregate function return?
A18.
| Function | Description               | Works on Nulls                            | Works on Non-Numeric |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| COUNT    | Number of values          | `COUNT(*)` includes nulls; others exclude | yes                   |
| SUM      | Total of numeric values   | Excludes nulls                            | no                    |
| AVG      | Average of numeric values | Excludes nulls                            | no                    |

| MAX      | Largest value             | Excludes nulls                            | yes                    |


--- Basic SQL --- GROUP BY, HAVING
Q1. What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause in SQL?
A1. The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns so that aggregate functions (like COUNT, SUM, etc.) can be applied to each group.

Q2. What does using GROUP BY help you obtain?
A2. It helps you get subtotals — for example, the number of staff in each branch.

Q3. In a query that includes both WHERE and GROUP BY, which one is applied first?
A3. The WHERE clause is applied first to filter individual rows, then GROUP BY forms groups from the remaining rows.

Q4. What does each group in a GROUP BY query represent?
A4. Each group represents a summary row or a result group that aggregates data for that category.

Q5. How can you find the number of staff in each branch and their total salaries?
A5. SELECT branchNo,
       COUNT(staffNo) AS count,
       SUM(salary) AS sum
FROM Staff
GROUP BY branchNo
ORDER BY branchNo;

Q6. What does the above query do?
A6. Groups the rows by branchNo.
Counts how many staff (COUNT(staffNo)) are in each branch.
Calculates the total salary (SUM(salary)) for each branch.
Orders the results by branchNo.

Q7. What is WITH ROLLUP used for in MySQL?
A7. It is used to generate summary rows (also called “sum of sums”) that provide subtotals and grand totals for grouped data.

Q8. Give an example of using WITH ROLLUP.
A8. SELECT branchNo,
       COUNT(staffNo) AS count,
       SUM(salary) AS sum
FROM Staff
GROUP BY branchNo WITH ROLLUP;

Q9. What does the WITH ROLLUP query add to the results?
A9. It adds an extra row showing the overall total (the sum of all groups).

Q10. What is the purpose of the HAVING clause?
A10. The HAVING clause is used to restrict or filter groups after they have been formed by the GROUP BY clause.

Q11. How is HAVING different from WHERE?
A11. WHERE filters individual rows before grouping.
HAVING filters groups after they are created.

Q12. What must appear in a HAVING clause?
A12. Column names used in the HAVING clause must either:
Appear in the GROUP BY list, or
Be contained within an aggregate function.

Q13. How can you find the number of staff in each branch and their total salaries, but only for branches with more than one staff member?
A13.
SELECT branchNo,
       COUNT(staffNo) AS count,
       SUM(salary) AS sum
FROM Staff
GROUP BY branchNo
HAVING COUNT(staffNo) > 1
ORDER BY branchNo;

Q14. What does this query do?
A14.
Groups staff by branchNo.
Calculates each branch’s staff count and total salary.
Displays only those branches where the number of staff is greater than one.
Orders the final result by branchNo.

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **GROUP BY**    | Groups rows with the same value for one or more columns | `GROUP BY branchNo`             |
| **WHERE**       | Filters individual rows before grouping                 | Must appear before `GROUP BY`   |
| **HAVING**      | Filters groups after grouping                           | `HAVING COUNT(staffNo) > 1`     |
| **WITH ROLLUP** | Adds summary rows for subtotals and totals (MySQL only) | `GROUP BY branchNo WITH ROLLUP` |


--- Subqueries ---

Q1: What is a subquery?
A1: A subquery is a nested or embedded SELECT statement inside another SQL query.

Q2: Where can a subquery be used in an SQL statement?
A2: A subquery can be used in the SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and HAVING clauses of an outer SELECT statement.

Q3: What are two example uses of subqueries?
A3:Constructing a query that uses data from two tables by utilizing foreign keys.
Constructing a query that uses an aggregate function in the WHERE clause.

Q4: What does Example 6.19 demonstrate?
A4: It shows how to use a subquery in the WHERE clause.

Q5: What is the goal of Example 6.19?
A5: To list staff who work in the branch at ‘163 Main St’ without hardcoding a specific branch number.

Q6: What is the SQL query in Example 6.19?
A6: SELECT staffNo, fName, lName, position
FROM Staff
WHERE branchNo =
   (SELECT branchNo
    FROM Branch
    WHERE street = '163 Main St');

Q7: What does Example 6.20 demonstrate?
A7: It demonstrates subqueries in both the WHERE and SELECT clauses.

Q8: What is the goal of Example 6.20?
A8: To list all staff whose salary is greater than the average salary and show how much more they earn than the average.

Q9: What is the SQL query in Example 6.20?
A9: SELECT staffNo, fName, lName, position,
       salary - (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Staff) AS salaryDiff
FROM Staff
WHERE salary >
      (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Staff);

Q10: What does Example 6.21 demonstrate?
A10: It demonstrates a doubly nested subquery using the IN operator.

Q11: What is the purpose of Example 6.21?
A11: To list properties handled by staff who work at ‘163 Main St’.

Q12: What is the SQL query in Example 6.21?
A12: SELECT propertyNo, street, city, postcode, type, rooms, rent
FROM PropertyForRent
WHERE staffNo IN
   (SELECT staffNo FROM Staff
    WHERE branchNo =
       (SELECT branchNo
        FROM Branch
        WHERE street = '163 Main St'));

Q13: What important note is mentioned about subqueries that return multiple rows?
A13: When a subquery returns more than one row, you must use the IN operator.

Q14: What does a subquery in the FROM clause create?
A14: It creates a derived table, from which the outer SELECT can pull data.

Q15: Why must a derived table be named?
A15: Because every table must have a name, so the derived table must be given an alias using AS.

Q16: What does the Example “Subquery in FROM” show?
A16: It shows how to calculate the average total salary cost for a branch using a subquery in the FROM clause.

Q17: What is the SQL query for the subquery in the FROM clause?
A17: SELECT AVG(sumColumn) AS avgSalaryCost
FROM (SELECT SUM(salary) AS sumColumn
      FROM Staff
      GROUP BY branchNo) AS sumTable;

Q18: Why can’t you write AVG(SUM(salary)) directly?
A18: Because aggregate functions cannot be nested directly. You must use a subquery to perform one aggregation first.

Q19: What is sumColumn in the above query?
A19: It is the alias for the inner query’s result (the sum of salaries per branch).

Q20: What is sumTable in the above query?
A20: It is the alias for the derived table created by the inner subquery.

--- ANY and ALL ---
Q1: What are the SQL keywords ANY and ALL used with?
A1: They are used with subqueries that produce a single column of numbers.

Q2: When using ALL, when will a condition be true?
A2: The condition will be true only if it is satisfied by all values produced by the subquery.

Q3: When using ANY, when will a condition be true?
A3: The condition will be true if it is satisfied by any one of the values produced by the subquery.

Q4: What happens if the subquery used with ANY or ALL is empty?
A4: With ALL, the condition returns true.
With ANY, the condition returns false.

Q5: What does Example 6.22 demonstrate?
A5: It shows how to use ANY with a subquery to compare salaries.

Q6: What is the goal of Example 6.22?
A6: To find staff whose salary is larger than the salary of at least one staff member at branch B003.

Q7: What is the SQL query from Example 6.22?
A7: SELECT staffNo, fName, lName, position, salary
FROM Staff
WHERE salary > ANY(SELECT salary
                   FROM Staff
                   WHERE branchNo = 'B003');

Q8: What values does the inner query in Example 6.22 produce?
A8: The inner query produces the set {4200, 3000, 5500}.

Q9: What does the outer query select based on that set?
A9: It selects staff whose salaries are greater than any of the values in that set.

Q10: What is the output of Example 6.22?
A10:
| staffNo | fName | lName | position   | salary |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| SG14    | David | Ford  | Supervisor | 4200   |
| SG5     | Susan | Brand | Manager    | 5500   |
| SL21    | John  | White | Manager    | 5300   |

Using MIN Instead of ANY
Q11: What can be used instead of ANY in Example 6.22?
A11: You can use the MIN function instead of ANY.

Q12: How are the two equivalent queries written?
A12:
Using ANY:
SELECT staffNo, lName, salary, branchNo
FROM Staff
WHERE salary > ANY (SELECT salary
                    FROM Staff
                    WHERE branchNo = 'B003');
Equivalent using MIN:
SELECT staffNo, lName, salary, branchNo
FROM Staff
WHERE salary > (SELECT MIN(salary)
                FROM Staff
                WHERE branchNo = 'B003');

Use of ALL
Q13: What does Example 6.23 demonstrate?
A13: It shows how to use ALL with a subquery to compare values.

Q14: What is the goal of Example 6.23?
A14: To find staff whose salary is equal to or larger than every staff member at branch B005.

Q15: What is the SQL query from Example 6.23?
A15: SELECT staffNo, fName, lName, position, salary
FROM Staff
WHERE salary >= ALL(SELECT salary
                    FROM Staff
                    WHERE branchNo = 'B003');

Q16: What is the output of Example 6.23?
A16:
| staffNo | fName | lName | position | salary |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | -------- | ------ |
| SG5     | Susan | Brand | Manager  | 5500   |

Using MAX Instead of ALL
Q17: What can be used instead of ALL in Example 6.23?
A17: The MAX function can be used instead of ALL.

Q18: How are the two equivalent queries written?
A18:
Using ALL:
SELECT staffNo, lName, salary, branchNo
FROM Staff
WHERE salary >= ALL (SELECT salary
                     FROM Staff
                     WHERE branchNo = 'B003');
Equivalent using MAX:
SELECT staffNo, lName, salary, branchNo
FROM Staff
WHERE salary >= (SELECT MAX(salary)
                 FROM Staff
                 WHERE branchNo = 'B003');

Table Aliases in Subqueries

SELECT staffNo, lName, salary, branchNo
FROM Staff s1
WHERE salary >= ALL (SELECT salary
                     FROM Staff s2
                     WHERE s1.branchNo = s2.branchNo);

Q22: What is the output of the table alias example?
A22:
| staffNo | lName | salary | branchNo |
| ------- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| SA9     | Howe  | 2800   | B007     |
| SG5     | Brand | 5500   | B003     |
