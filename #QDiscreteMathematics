SET THEORY

#1 What is a set and elements in mathematics?
- A set is a collection of objects that share something in common, such as numbers, letters, or other items.
- In discrete mathematics, we usually work with sets of numbers. An object that belongs to a set is called an element.

#2 How can you describe a set?
- A set can be described in three ways:
1. In text-format: "A is a set of all numbers greater than 3"
2. As enumeration: For example , A = {3,4,5,...}
3. As a set-builder notation: For example, A = {x∣x≥3 and x∈Z}, meaning "A is the set of all x such that x is greater than or equal to 3, and x is an integer."

#3 What does it mean for an element to belong to a set, how do we express that?
- If an element (x) belongs to a set (A), we write 𝑥∈𝐴. If an element does not belong to a set, we write 𝑥∉𝐴

#4 What is a subset?
- A set (B) is a subset of a set (A) if all elements in (B) are also in (A). This is written as 𝐵⊆𝐴.
- If (A) contains more elements than (B), then we call (B) a proper subset, which is written as 𝐵⊂𝐴.

#5 What is cardinality?
- The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. If A = {1,2,5}, then the cardinality is |A| = 3

#6 What are the natural numbers?
- The natural numbers 𝑁 are the set of non-negative integers, i.e., 𝑁 = {0,1,2,3,....}

#7 What are the integers?
- The integers 𝑍 include both positive and negative whole numbers, as well as zero. That is, 𝑍 = {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}

#8 What are rational numbers?
- Rational numbers Q are numbers that can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers and b (eg base) not equals to 0

#9 What are real numbers?
- Real numbers R include all rational numbers as well as irrational numbers (such as sqrt(2),π, and 𝑒)

#10 What are complex numbers?
- Complex numbers C are numbers of the form a+bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit (i^2 =-1)

#11 What is the union of sets?
- The union A U B of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that are in either A, B or both, each number is mentioned once if the number is in both
- For example, if A = {1,2} and B = {2,3,5}, then A U B = {1,2,3,5}

#12 What is the intersection of sets?
- The intersection A ∩ B of two sets A and B is set of all elements that are in both A and B.
- If A = {1,2}. If A ={1,2} and B = {2,3,5}, then A ∩ B = {2}

#13 What is the difference of sets?
- The difference A\B of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that are in A but not in B.
- For example , if A = {1,2} and B = {2,3,5}, then A\B = {1}

#14 What is the complement of a set?
- the complement A^c of a set A in a universal set U is the set of all elements U that are not in A.
- If A = {1,2} and U = {0,1,2,3,4,5}, then the complement A^c = {0,3,4,5}

#15 What is the universal set?
- The universal set 𝑈 is the set that contains all possible elements in a given context.
- For example, if we are working with sets of integers, 𝑈 could be the set of all integers.

#16 What is the empty set?
- The empty set ∅ is a set that contains no elements.

#17 What does 𝐴=B mean?
- If two sets A=B are equal, i.e A=B, it means that they contain exactly the same elements.
