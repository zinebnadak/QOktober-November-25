--- DISCRETE MATHEMATHICS ---
Discrete Mathematics is crucial for IT engineers because it provides the foundations for logic, algorithms, and problem-solving. Key points:

Logic & Proofs → helps write correct programs and reason about code.

Algorithms & Data Structures → graphs, trees, sets, relations underpin software and networks.

Combinatorics & Probability → important for cryptography, security, and data analysis.

Graph Theory → models networks, routing, and connectivity.

Finite State Machines → essential for compilers, protocols, and system design.


---SET THEORY---

#1 What is a set and elements in mathematics?
- A set is a collection of objects that share something in common, such as numbers, letters, or other items.
- In discrete mathematics, we usually work with sets of numbers. An object that belongs to a set is called an element.

#2 How can you describe a set?
- A set can be described in three ways:
1. In text-format: "A is a set of all numbers greater than 3"
2. As enumeration: For example , A = {3,4,5,...}
3. As a set-builder notation: For example, A = {x∣x≥3 and x∈Z}, meaning everything said after the "|" describes conditions the element of set "x" needs to have. Here A is the set of all x such that x is greater than or equal to 3, and x is an integer."

#3 What does it mean for an element to belong to a set, how do we express that?
- If an element (x) belongs to a set (A), we write 𝑥∈𝐴. If an element does not belong to a set, we write 𝑥∉𝐴

#4 What is a subset?
- A set (B) is a subset of a set (A) if all elements in (B) are also in (A). This is written as 𝐵⊆𝐴.
- If (A) contains more elements than (B), then we call (B) a proper subset, which is written as 𝐵⊂𝐴.
the direction of the symbol is important of how we read the notation.
.
#5 What is cardinality?
- The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. If A = {1,2,5}, then the cardinality is |A| = 3

#6 What are the natural numbers?
- The natural numbers 𝑁 are the set of non-negative integers, i.e., 𝑁 = {0,1,2,3,....}

#7 What are the integers?
- The integers 𝑍 include both positive and negative whole numbers, as well as zero. That is, 𝑍 = {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}

#8 What are rational numbers?

#9 What are real numbers?
- Real numbers R include all rational numbers as well as irrational numbers (such as sqrt(2),π, and 𝑒)

#10 What are complex numbers?
- Complex numbers C are numbers of the form a+bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit (i^2 =-1)

#11 What is the union of sets?
- The union A U B of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that are in either A, B or both, each number is mentioned once if the number is in both
- For example, if A = {1,2} and B = {2,3,5}, then A U B = {1,2,3,5}

#12 What is the intersection of sets?
- The intersection A ∩ B of two sets A and B is set of all elements that are in both A and B.
- If A = {1,2}. If A ={1,2} and B = {2,3,5}, then A ∩ B = {2}

#13 What is the difference of sets?
- The difference A\B of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that are in A but not in B.
- For example , if A = {1,2} and B = {2,3,5}, then A\B = {1}

#14 What is the complement of a set?
- the complement A^c of a set A in a universal set U is the set of all elements U that are not in A.
- If A = {1,2} and U = {0,1,2,3,4,5}, then the complement A^c = {0,3,4,5}

#15 What is the universal set?
- The universal set 𝑈 is the set that contains all possible elements in a given context.
- For example, if we are working with sets of integers, 𝑈 could be the set of all integers.

#16 What is the empty set?
- The empty set ∅ is a set that contains no elements.

#17 What does 𝐴=B mean?
- If two sets A=B are equal, i.e A=B, it means that they contain exactly the same elements.

--- LINEAR EQUATIONS ---
#1 What is the general equation of a straight line?

#2 How do you calculate the slope 𝑘 of a line given two points?

k > 0 means the line rises, k = 0 means it is horizontal, and k < 0 means it falls.

#12 What is the addition (elimination) method for solving a linear system?
Add or subtract equations to eliminate one variable, possibly after multiplying an equation.

#14 Why might the graphical method not be exact?
Because drawing or reading the graph may give an approximate solution, not the exact values.

#15 When does a linear system have infinitely many solutions?
When the lines coincide, meaning they have the same slope and y-intercept.

#16 When does a linear system have no solution?
When the lines are parallel and never intersect.

#17 What is the intersection point of two lines?
It is the point where the lines meet; its coordinates satisfy both equations.

#19 Can any linear system be solved using either substitution or addition?
Yes, both methods will give the same solution if it exists.

#20 What should you always do first in the substitution method?
Solve one equation for one variable before substituting it into the other equation.

- Induction step: Show it then holds for n = p + 1.

21. How can induction be used to prove the sum of the first n positive integers?
* Base case: 1 = 1.
* Hypothesis: 1 + 2 + ... + p = p * (p + 1) / 2.
* Step: 1 + 2 + ... + p + (p + 1) = (p + 1) * (p + 2) / 2.
